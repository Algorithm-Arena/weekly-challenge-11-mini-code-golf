# Weekly Challenge #11 - Mini Code Golf

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that lets you play mini golf where the source code is using the smallest amount of characters.** [Code Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) is a fun activity where you're trying to minify your code as much as possible. Mini golf is a fun game where you're trying to put a ball into a hole respecting the laws of physics. Combining the two should make for a fun challenge!
