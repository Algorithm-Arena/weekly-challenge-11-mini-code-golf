# Weekly Challenge #11 - Mini Code Golf

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that lets you play mini golf where the source code is using the smallest amount of characters.** [Code Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) is a fun activity where you're trying to minify your code as much as possible. Mini golf is a fun game where you're trying to put a ball into a hole respecting the laws of physics. Combining the two should make for a fun challenge!

### Winners:

* In first place, @BenjaminAster wins $100. Insane how in 1099 bytes he got a fully working minigolf with physics and 52 levels! Using randomly generated circles for obstacles is so clever. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-11-mini-code-golf/issues/5

* In second place, @nikpundik wins $60. I was confused when I read the description of a console based mini golf in 941 bytes. But it turns out to be really clever and fun! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-11-mini-code-golf/issues/2

* In third place, @are wins $40. When I created the challenge I was only thinking about 2d surfaces but this submission in 3048 bytes also implement hills! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-11-mini-code-golf/issues/1

* As honorable mention, @Uzo2005 implemented minigolf in python in 3382 bytes, this is a really unusual language for code golf so it's interesting to see how small code looks! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-11-mini-code-golf/issues/4

* As honorable mention, @evgenyvinnik took an existing minigolf game and minified it to 23393 bytes. This is a good way to learn code golfing skills! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-11-mini-code-golf/issues/3
